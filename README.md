# LAB: HTML Resume

## Get Started
- [Clone](https://nss-evening-curriculum.netlify.app/client/08-clone-github-repos) this repo into `~/workspace/foundations/inclass/`
- Make setup branch with `index.html, main.css, main.js` files
- Change background color of `index.html` 
- Add a console log in `main.js`
- TEST YOUR CODE, then Push to GitHub, create a PR, and merge to main

## The Task
You will be building an HTML version of your resume

### HTML
- Each place you've worked must be contained in an article element.
- Each article element should have a header that contains the name of the company and the dates of your employment. BONUS: Ensure that the dates are semantically marked by being contained within the appropriate HTML element.
- Each article should have its own id.
- Each article should contain at least one section that describes your position there.

### CSS
- Each article should use a different font family.
- All article headings should be the same font color (don't be boring).
- Site should have a background color or background image. Images google filtered for "Royalty Free"
- Each article should have a different border(weight,style,color).

NOTE: If you have less than two previous employers, either use your educational instituions as a substitute or make them up.

# DOCUMENTATION 
## ðŸŒ¸ DAY ONE - 7/11/2023 
> Getting intial setup and first commits done.

> Made intiial commit and setup. Created and tested setup. Tests were successful. Created PR and then merged with main branch. Deleted Setup branch. 

### Semantic HTML  
Creating HTML structures that appeal to meaning rather than appearance. <div> and <span> aren't very semantic. They don't MEAN anything! They're just a way to divide your page up. However, <nav>, <section>, and other semantic forms of HTML mean something.

## ðŸŒ¸ DAY TWO - 7/12/2023 
Created the structure and styling for the page. Got hung up on the border part.
